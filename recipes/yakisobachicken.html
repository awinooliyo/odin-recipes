    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yakisoba chicken is a Japanese stir-fried noodle dish that features chicken as its primary protein. The term "yakisoba" translates to "fried noodles" in Japanese, and it's a popular street food and casual meal option in Japan.</p>
    <p>To prepare Yakisoba Chicken, start by cooking 8 ounces of yakisoba noodles according to package instructions, or substitute with spaghetti noodles if unavailable. Meanwhile, thinly slice 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinate them in a mixture of 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 clove of minced garlic for at least 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the remaining soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar, and black pepper to create the sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, then stir-fry the marinated chicken until cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil and cook sliced onion, julienned carrot, and chopped cabbage for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened.</p>
    <p>Return the cooked noodles and chicken to the skillet, then pour the prepared sauce over the mixture. Toss everything together until well combined and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat through. Serve the Yakisoba Chicken hot, garnished with chopped green onions, sesame seeds, and chopped cilantro if desired. Adjust ingredients and seasonings to taste preferences, and enjoy this flavorful dish!</p>
