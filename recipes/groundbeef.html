        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These ground beef stroganoff noodles are a shortcut version of classic beef stroganoff in a one-pan version. The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles.</p>
        <p>To make Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles, begin by cooking 8 ounces of wide egg noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. While the noodles are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</p>
        <p>Once the oil is hot, add 1 pound of lean ground beef and cook it until it's browned and no longer pink, breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks. Stir in 1 diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic, cooking until the onion is softened and the garlic is fragrant, which takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour over the beef mixture, stirring well to combine and cook for another minute. Next, pour in 2 cups of beef broth, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens slightly. Reduce the heat to low and stir in 1 cup of sour cream until it's fully incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Finally, add the cooked noodles to the skillet, tossing them gently to coat them evenly in the sauce. Allow the dish to simmer for a few minutes to heat through. Serve the Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy this comforting and flavorful meal!</p>
