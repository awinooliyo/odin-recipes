        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>American lasagna is a hearty and popular Italian-American dish that has become a staple in American cuisine. It typically consists of layers of lasagna noodles, seasoned ground meat (often beef or a combination of beef and pork), tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes Parmesan cheese. The dish is assembled in a baking dish and baked until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>
    <p>The process of making American lasagna involves several steps. First, the ground meat is cooked with onions, garlic, and Italian seasonings until browned and flavorful. Then, tomato sauce is added to the meat mixture, creating a rich and savory sauce.</p>
    <p>Next, a layer of cooked lasagna noodles is spread on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of the meat sauce and dollops of ricotta cheese. This process is repeated until the dish is filled, usually ending with a layer of sauce and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella cheese on top.</p>
    <p>The assembled lasagna is then baked in the oven until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly, and the flavors have melded together. Once cooked, it is typically allowed to cool for a few minutes before being sliced and served.</p>
    <p>American lasagna is a comforting and satisfying dish that is perfect for feeding a crowd or for enjoying as leftovers. It can be customized with additional ingredients such as vegetables, sausage, or different types of cheese, allowing for endless variations to suit individual tastes.</p>
